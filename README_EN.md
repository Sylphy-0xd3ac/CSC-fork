## Local Testing

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18.0 or higher installed.
  - The backend is tested with the latest LTS version of Node.js, so it is recommended to use the latest LTS version.

---

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the Repository**:

   Download Actions artifacts.

   ```bash
   cd source
   ```

2. **Start the Backend**:
   Execute:

   ```bash
   node main.js
   ```

3. **Test the Backend**:
   Open the `index.html` file in the `client` folder using your browser. If the homepage is displayed successfully, the backend is running correctly.

---

## Deployment and Configuration

1. **Client Setup**:
   Compress `client.zip`
   Copy the `client` folder and configure your web server to serve the frontend files.

2. **Run on the Same Server**:
   Ensure that the backend (`main.js`) and frontend (from the `client` folder) are hosted on the same server.
